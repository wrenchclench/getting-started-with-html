  <b> BASICS OF WEB AND HTML NOTES: <a href="au.linkedin.com/in/jbudreski/en"> BUDRESKI</a></b><br>
<br>
<b>Intro:</b> The web is made up of HTML, URLS, HTTP, Web apps<br>
- Browsers send requests via  the internet and http to servers which host the files and send them back to the browser for the user<br>

- Just about any file can be found on the web<br>
<br>
HTML = <em>Hypertext markup lanaguage</em><br>
- composed of: text content, markup, ref. to other docs<br>
- plain text = plain text<br>
- to change the text you need markup<br>
<br>
Markup:<br>
Tags - tags have an opening tag and a closing tag<br>
<em>ex:</em> < name > contents < /name > and the whole string is an <em>element</em><br>
Bold tag = < b> content < /b><br>
Italics = < em> content < /em><br>
Note: If you don't close out a tag then the rest of the content on the page will be with that tag<br>
<br>

<b>Attributes in HTML:</b><br>
Will look like: <em>< Tag ATTR="value">contents< /tag></em><br>
<br>

- <b>Anchor tag</b> - < a> < /a><br>
- Used for making links on a webpage
<em>example: < a href="www.kdhgfihd.com">HTML< /a></em><br>
<br>

-<b>Image tag</b> Image tag - < img><br> 
- Considered a <em>void tag</em>, meaning you don't have to close it
<em>example: < img src="imgage url" alt="text"></em><br>
<br>

<b>Note: You need to have alt=text in the case the image fails to load</b><br>
<br>

- <b>Break tag</b> - < br> - also a void tag <br>

- Makes text move down to the next line<br>
- Only need to put it once right after where you want the next line to begin<br>
<br>

- <b>Paragraph tag</b> - < p> < /p><br>
- Keeps content in a specified box<br>
<br>

<b>Note: a < br> tag is an inline and a < p> tag makes a box which you can set height and width of the box</b><br>
<br>

<b>Elements:</b><br>
- Elements contain their content. You can attach styles to them via CSS<br>

< span> < /span> are inline<br>
< div> < /div> are block<br>
<br>
